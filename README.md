# Joe's RideTandem take-home developer assessment

[todo: quick run instructions here]

## Starting tasks:

- [x] Carefully read supplied README
- [x] Clone supplied repo to local
- [x] Move supplied README to new file
- [x] Create new README
- [x] Start writing this plan! :¬)
- [x] Create repo on GitHub
- [x] Remove current remotes (`git remote remove origin`)
- [x] Add new remotes
  - `git remote add origin git@github.com-joe-dev-public:joe-dev-public/ridetandem-developer-assessment.git`
- [x] Create GitHub issues for supplied user stories (required features)


## Plan:

- [ ] Check supplied code
  - [x] `yarn install` and `yarn dev` in both `/api` and `/web`.
- [ ] For each user story I've created, work out what needs to be added/changed
- [ ] Work through implementing each user story!
  - Ideally use feature branch per story, where possible.
  - (But given time and scope constraints, they might proceed in parallel, so some overlapping is OK.)
- [ ] Add stretch user stories (improvements/extensions)
  - (During implementation, or when supplied user stories are completed.)
- [ ] Update the supplied user stories or this plan as you go, if required :¬)
